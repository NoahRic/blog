I'm in a jolly mood, having just bought a new sofa and chair at IKEA and getting rid of my old one (it was the nastiest piece of furniture in the entire apartment), so I decided to share this feeling of getting something new and shiny.  To be clear, though, I am not buying you a sofa at IKEA.

Instead, I've posted out an alpha version of [Markdown Mode on the vsgallery][markdown-vsgallery]!  Not quite as cool as a new sofa, I know, but I hope you'll enjoy it anyways.

Here's another quick screenshot of Markdown Mode version 0.1:

</a>

The new color scheme is something Chris Granger wrote; if anyone is interested in it, I'll forward those requests on to him.

You can also read/download the [source on github][markdown-github].  At this stage, while I'm still doing fairly active development, there will changes there that I won't push out to the VS Gallery immediately.

The one thing that I really don't have a great idea for yet is the icon for Markdown Mode.  There doesn't seem to be an *official* Markdown icon, and I doubt I'd have the license or talent to modify it for my purposes anyways, so I just stuck with a slightly stylized "mark" - "down" (split over two lines, to accommodate the 32x32 size that the extension manager uses): ![][markdown-icon].  I've set the screenshot to a 198x198 pixel clip of the screenshot I posted above.

If you get a chance to try it out, let me know on twitter (@noahsmark).  I'd love to hear any feedback you may have.
